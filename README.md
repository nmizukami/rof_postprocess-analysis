# CESM ROF history diagnositic analysis notebooks

**NOTEBOOK lists**
1. NB1 ROF monthly, annual, and seasonality flow analysis with global ocean discharge reference dataset (D19: Dai 2017)
2. NB2 ROF daily flow analysis with global daily gauge reference dataset (H14: Beck et al., 2020)
3. NB3 ROF ocean discharge analysis at monthly acale with global ocean discharge reference dataset (D19)
4. NB4 ROF monthly, annual, and seasonality flow analysis for a specific river basin. 
5. NB5 River network visualization.
6. NB6 Ocean basins visualization.
7. NB7 Spatial mapping of river network catchment runoff and river flows (monthly scale).

**NOTES**
- Use NB1, NB2 and NB3 for CESM case inter-comparison.
- NB5 and NB6 is one time visualization, NOT meant to be run after every simulations.
- NB7 is slow, depending on underlying network used. it is meant for sanity check for spatial pattern.
